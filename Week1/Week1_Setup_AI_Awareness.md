## AI Awareness Reflection
Describe one AI tool (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Edu, etc.) you explored.  
- How did it help (or confuse) you during setup?
- Github copilot at first confused me but then helped me with the setup process as I was having issues with getting python to work with VSCode or running my first .py file.
- How will you verify its suggestions in the future?  
- I will be going to another platform to verify the information or step by step process when I use Github Copilot once more. While AI is useful and straight to the point, some of it's responses are a bit confusing.
